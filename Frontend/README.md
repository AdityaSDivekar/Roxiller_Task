I have used the ui components libraries like shadcn,matrialUI,react_charts tailwindcss for styling 
i have created routes for statistics, tabel and bar;
data for all functionalities will be taken from backend and it will filter on the basis of the month and their is also search functionality that will search the field for filtering the data and shown in  the table as per the month and the applied filter if not then
bby default show the data of march 
in statistics it shows the total amount products sold and total product not sold 
for graph it shows the products as per prise range all the data will be takn from the apis from the backend 
for built in cards and graphs and tabels i used the ui component libraries 
axios for api integration and also other core functinalities of the react
all the components and routs are individually working properly
 for backend see backend readme
